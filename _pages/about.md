Brief Intro
---
I am a PhD Student since May 2022, working on Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of Prof. [Marcello Restelli](http://home.deib.polimi.it/restelli/MyWebSite/index.shtml), at the Department of Electronics, Informatics and Bio-engineering
([DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/)) of Politecnico di Milano.

Some History
---
Between 2019 and 2022 I worked first as a R&D Control Engineer for [e-Novia](https://e-novia.it/), then briefly as an Embedded SW Engineer for [Kalpa](https://www.kalpa.it/), and finally as a Research Scholar at [DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/) working on Distributed Methods for Industry 4.0.

In October 2019, I received my Master of Science in Automation and Control Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (with honors), defending the thesis "[Introducing a proprio-ceptive feedback in the bio-inspired Tegotae control approach : enhanced learning and energy efficiency](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/149946)", under the supervision of Prof. [Fabio Dercole](https://dercole.faculty.polimi.it/index.html) and Prof. [Mitsuhiro Hayashibe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2VmKkUkAAAAJ&hl=en), which resulted from a visiting research program at the [Neuro-Robotics Laboratory](http://neuro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/) of Tohoku Univesity.

In July 2017, I obtained a Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering from University of Trento (with honors), defending a thesis on [Mathematical Control Theory](/files/tesi-triennale.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}) (in Italian, unfortunately).

Teaching Activities
---
In the Academic Years 2022-2023 & 2023-2024 I have been working as Teaching Assistant for the Course of [Informatics](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=EVENTO&c_insegn=081369&aa=2022&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=352&ac_ins=0&k_indir=ENN&lang=EN&tipoCorso=ALL_TIPO_CORSO&semestre=1&idItemOfferta=159766&idRiga=283265&codDescr=081369) by Prof. [A. Marchesi](https://albymarke.github.io/). 

In the Academic Year 2002-2023 I did some Tutoring Activities for the [Master in Data Science & AI](https://masterdatascienceai.cefriel.it/) held by Cefriel.


Research Interests
---
My main research interests focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL), and more specifically <b>Distributed Reinfocement Learning</b>. I am currently investigating on the frontiers between single-agent and multi-agent problems. The aim is to develop a theoretical understanding of how single-agent methods can be distributed through communication and information sharing, without paying too much in terms of RL performance. (un)Fortunately, little has changed since [Laurer & Riedmiller (2000)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645529.658113).

Industrial Collaborations
---
I am collaborating with [Siemens AT](https://new.siemens.com/at/de.html) on potential applications of Distributed RL for Industry 4.0, in particular for the distributed control of a production plant, which usually goes under the umbrella name of Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (I believe a good old introduction can be found [here](https://d-nb.info/996018298/34)).
