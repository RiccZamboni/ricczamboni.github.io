Briefly
---
I am a PhD Student, working on Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of Prof. [Marcello Restelli](http://home.deib.polimi.it/restelli/MyWebSite/index.shtml), at the Department of Electronics, Informatics and Bio-engineering
([DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/)) of Politecnico di Milano.


Research Interests
---
My main research interests focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL), and more specifically <b>Multi-Agent Reinfocement Learning</b> (MARL). Generally, I am investigating on the role of information past single-agent scenarios, with the long term goal of passing over the existing (and often limiting) common frameworks, like data abundance (i.e. fast simulation) and Centralized Training (as for Chapter 9.1 of this [nice book](https://www.marl-book.com/download/marl-book.pdf)). 
More specifically, I am working on developing an understanding of how single-agent methods can be distributed through communication of information, how (decision-making) data should be collected a-priori of a task in the presence of partial observability and strategic entities, and what it the best way to learn over it offline once it is collected.

Industrial Collaborations
---
I am passionate about applying RL to challenging tasks and looking for new ways towards principled MARL for real-world applications, being a chance for pushing forwards the bounds of such techniques once they clash with the complexity of non-simplified scenarios. 
Throughout my PhD, I collaborated with [Siemens AT](https://new.siemens.com/at/de.html) on applying scalable MARL techniques for Industry 4.0 and Industrial Production Scheduling.

Teaching Activities
---
In the Academic Years 2022-2023 & 2023-2024 I have been working as Teaching Assistant for the Course of [Informatics](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=EVENTO&c_insegn=081369&aa=2022&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=352&ac_ins=0&k_indir=ENN&lang=EN&tipoCorso=ALL_TIPO_CORSO&semestre=1&idItemOfferta=159766&idRiga=283265&codDescr=081369) by Prof. [A. Marchesi](https://albymarke.github.io/). 

In the Academic Year 2022-2023 I did some Tutoring Activities for the [Master in Data Science & AI](https://masterdatascienceai.cefriel.it/) held by Cefriel.

Work Experience
---
Between 2019 and 2022 I worked first as a R&D Control Engineer for [e-Novia](https://e-novia.it/), then briefly as an Embedded SW Engineer for [Kalpa](https://www.kalpa.it/), and finally as a Research Scholar at [DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/) working on Distributed Methods for Industry 4.0.

Education
---

In October 2019, I received my Master of Science in Automation and Control Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (with honors), defending the thesis "[Introducing a proprio-ceptive feedback in the bio-inspired Tegotae control approach : enhanced learning and energy efficiency](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/149946)", under the supervision of Prof. [Fabio Dercole](https://dercole.faculty.polimi.it/index.html) and Prof. [Mitsuhiro Hayashibe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2VmKkUkAAAAJ&hl=en), which resulted from a visiting research program at the [Neuro-Robotics Laboratory](http://neuro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/) of Tohoku Univesity.

In July 2017, I obtained a Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering from University of Trento (with honors), defending a thesis on [Mathematical Control Theory](/files/tesi-triennale.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (in Italian, unfortunately).
