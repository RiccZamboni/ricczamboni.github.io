I am a PhD candidate at Politecnico di Milano, working under the supervision of Prof. [Marcello Restelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdgxRiEAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [RL^3 Group](https://rl.airlab.deib.polimi.it).

You can check out my (mostly up-to-date) CV [here](/files/Academic_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, but for the freshest updates, my Scholar or BlueSky profiles might be more reliable. And if you're curious about anything, feel free to drop me an email, I’m always happy to chat!

My research is in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and I am especially interested in getting around some of the usual pain points, like relying on massive amounts of data, training everything from scratch, or needing centralized schemes when multiple agents are involved. Real-world applications don’t always play by those rules, unfortunately.

Lately, I have been focused on what we can do before the actual task is even defined, things like pre-training models that make RL agents more general, more adaptable, and with more diverse behaviors. My goal is to develop methods that scale, generalize well, and are ready to tackle real-world messiness head-on.

To that end, I have dived into topics like partial observability, multi-agent RL, and decision-making under general utility functions. I have also worked with Siemens AT to bring scalable multi-agent RL into industrial production scheduling, because what’s cooler than seeing theory meet factory floors?
