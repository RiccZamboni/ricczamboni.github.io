Intro
---
I am a PhD Student at the Department of Electronics, Informatics and Bio-engineering
([DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/)) of Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi), under the supervision of Prof. [Marcello Restelli](http://home.deib.polimi.it/restelli/MyWebSite/index.shtml), since May 2022. 
Between 2019 and 2022 I had several work experiences. First as a R&D Control Engineer for [e-Novia](https://e-novia.it/), then briefly as an Embedded SW Engineer for [Kalpa](https://www.kalpa.it/), and finally as a Research Scholar at [DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/) working on Distributed Methods for Industry 4.0.
In October 2019, I received my Master of Science in Automation and Control Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (with honors), defending the thesis "[Introducing a proprio-ceptive feedback in the bio-inspired Tegotae control approach : enhanced learning and energy efficiency](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/149946)",
under the supervision of Prof. [Fabio Dercole](https://dercole.faculty.polimi.it/index.html) and Prof. [Mitsuhiro Hayashibe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2VmKkUkAAAAJ&hl=en), which resulted from a visiting research program at the [Neuro-Robotics Laboratory](http://neuro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/) of Tohoku Univesity.
In July 2017, I obtained a Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering from University of Trento (with honors), defending a thesis on [Mathematical Control Theory](/files/tesi-triennale.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}) (in Italian, unfortunately).

Research Interests
---
My main research interests focus on Reinforcement Learning, and more specifically <b>Multi-Agent Reinfocement Learning</b>. I am currently working on distributed reinforcement learning, investigating on the frontiers between single-agent and multi-agent methods. The aim is to develop adaptive and multi-resolution factorization techniques in the multi-agent space.

Research Collaborations
---
I am collaborating with [Siemens AT](https://new.siemens.com/at/de.html) on potential applications of Multi-agent RL for Industry 4.0, in particular for the distributed control of a production plant.
